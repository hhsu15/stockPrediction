## Course Description

Recommendation engines are used across a wide variety of applications to improve the customer experience by trying to determine what the user wants to do next. Most recommendation engines work by analyzing relationships. In retail, a recommendation engine would look at the relationships between customers and the relationships between customers and their purchases, and then use that information to provide relevant recommendations. In this course, we'll learn about the two main types of recommender systems: content-based and collaborative-based.
